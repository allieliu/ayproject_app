<h1>About</h1>
<h3>Twitionary is an API intended for Twitter Users.

The evolution of slang is a quickly evolving beast. One day your mutuals could be saying 'dragged' or 'clocked', and the next day 'flop'. Don't even know what a mutual is? You're in the right place!

Any person with an active Twitter account can log in with their
account and can enter any slang with their definition. Users can also view what others have already submitted.
